# gettoknowaplace_restaurant_db

## Introduction

Gettoknowaplace offers personalised recommendations to newcomers in big cities, based on paid for research topics.

The brief was to create an entity relationship diagram for a database of restaurants in Barcelona. We had the following questions to answer:

1. Which parts of the city have the most restaurants per sq km?
2. Where can a vegan burger restaurant be found, with an opening time filter... eg. customer wants to visit on thursday at 6pm?
3. How many specified cuisine (eg Vietnamese) restaurants are there in the city?
4. Which restaurants are the best for big groups/parties?

## ERD Structure

In order to be able to answer our clients questions regarding restaurants in Barcelona, we have structured the database so that it can be easily queried for a variety of topics. Each table is linked to the main restaurant table and we have added additional links between other useful tables, such as location and cuisine.

The tables include information about primary and foreign keys as well as data types for each field.

## Process

We started by sketching potential relationships between known entities to start to conceptualise the tables we would need and poential links between them.

We used LucidChart to create the schema. This tool allowed us to easily design, connect and make changes to the tables and to work collaborativley on the project making simultaneous edits.

## Further Steps

Having access to data on real life questions from restaurant goers in Barcelona would be helpful to be able to better structure the tables and engineer more efficient connections.
