# gettoknowaplace_restaurant_db

## Introduction

Our repository for the Gettoknowaplace project.

This is a entity relationship diagram for a restaurant database for restaurants around Barcelona.

## ERD Structure

In order to be able to answer our clients questions regarding restaurants in Barcelona, we have structured this database so that it can be easily queried for a variety of topics. Each table is linked to the main restaurant table and we have added additional links between other useful tables, such as location and cuisine.

The tables include information about primary and foreign keys as well as data types for each field.

## Process

We started by sketching potential relationships between known entities to start to conceptualise the tables we would need and poential links between them.

We used LucidChart to create the schema. This tool allowed us to easily design, connect and make changes to the tables and to work collaborativley on the project making simultaneous edits.

## Further Steps

Having access to data on real life questions from restaurant goers in Barcelona would be helpful to be able to better structure the tables and engineer more efficient connections.
